# Automatic-Hand-Sanitizer-Dispenser
An Automatic Sanitizer Dispenser are used Automatic Sanitized our hand properly without touch to machine.
An Automatic Sanitizer Dispenser are used Automatic Sanitized our hand properly without touch to machine. To avoid covid-19 the main thing is to take precautions and sanitized your hand regularly. To sanitized automatically hand this project are used but due high cost people not afford it our aim is to provide machine with minimum cost.

This project is based on an infrared (IR) sensor, which detects the presence of hands and consequently activates the motor pump to dispense alcohol-based sanitiser. The circuit is economical, reliable, and can be easily constructed

The project uses 5V DC to drive the circuit. When the IR sensor detects a hand, its output goes high. This high output drives relay driver transistor (BC547) and energises relay RL1. Submersible DC pump gets power supply through NO contacts of the relay. This turns on the DC pump, and hand sanitiser liquid starts to flow out of the small plastic pipe fitted on the bottle.
When there is no hand or object in front of the IR sensor, its output goes low. This low output cuts off relay driver transistor (BC547) and de-energises relay. When the submersible pump disconnects from the power supply, the DC pump goes off, which stops the flow of hand sanitiser.
